## HTML
- Html is an overall structure of a webpage
- Html is made up of characters that live inside of angled brackets - that code is called an HTML element
- HTML elements are made up of two tags, an opening and closing tag
- Each element tells the browser something about the information that sits between its opening and closing tags

- body
> Everything inside the element is shown inside the main browser

- head
> the head tag shows information about the page

- title
> shown either at the top of the browser or inside of the URL

- Doctype
> using a doctype declaration will tell the browser which version of HTML to use and will also help the browser render the page correctly

- Commenting out
> you can use a specific tag to make lines of code not render onto the webpage using <!- -comment goes here-->

- ID
> The ID attribute is known as a global variable

- Elements
1. Some elements will always appear to start on a new line in the browser window. Those are known as block level elements
2. Some elements will always appear to continue on the same line as their neighboring elements, these are known as inline elements

- nav tag
> the nav element is used to contain the major navigational blocks on the site such as the primary site navigation

- Article tag
