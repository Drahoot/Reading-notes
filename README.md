# Reading-notes
many different text editors are available and most usually come down to preference
can be downloaded or accessed online
one with code completion would be nice
syntax highlighting makes it easier by making code more visually distinguishable

NotePad++ It has syntax highlighting and code completion, as well as word completion and function completion
text wrangler good for mac users
BB edit is a horrible choice becuase you have to pay for it
VSC has everything that the previos applications offer
atom is more versatile on what system you can use, similar use to VSC

An IDE is an all in one package; ex. Text editor, file manager, compiler, debugger
IDE would be better for someone that is experienced
