 # HTML & CSS (Jon Duckett pg 406-427, 476-492)
 
 ## Background images
 - The background-image property allows yo to place an image behind any HTML element. This could be the entire page or just part of the page. By default, a background image will repeat to fill the entire box
 - With the background image element you can use the following methods
 1. repeat
 - The background image is repeated both horizontally and vetrically
 2. repeat-x
 - The image is repeated horizontally only
 3. repeat-y
 - The image is repeated vertically only
 4. no-repeat
 - The image is only shown once
 5. fixed
 - The background image stays in the same position on the page
 6. scroll
 - The background image moves up and down as the user scrolls up and down the page


The properties must be specified in the following order, however you can misss any value if you do not want to specify it
1. background-color
2. background-image
3. vackground-repeat
4. background-attachment
5. background-position

- Rollover
> Using CSS, it is possible to create a link or button that changes to a second style when a user moves their mouse over it and a third style when they click on it

- Sprite
> When a single image is used for several different parts of an interface, it is known as a sprite. You can add the logo and other interface elements, as well as buttons to the image

- If you want to overlay text on a background image, the image must be low contrast in order for the text to be legible
