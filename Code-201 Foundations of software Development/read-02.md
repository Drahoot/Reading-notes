# HTML & CSS (Jon Duckett Pg 40-61, 226-245)

- Html has six levels of headings
1. h1 is used for main headings
2. h2 is for subheadings
3. if there are further sections under the subheadings then h3 element and so on is used instead

- p tag
> To create a paragraph, surround the words that make up the paragraph with an opening and closing p tag

- b tag
> enclosing words in a b tag will make the characters appear bold

- i tag
> similar to the b tag but will italisize instead

- sup and sub tags
> will make characters appear slightly above or below another part of the text

- White space
> when the broswer comes across two or more spaces nex to each other, it will only display a insgle space.
> Similarly if it comes across a line break, it treats it as a single space as well.
> This is known as WHITESPACING

- br / tag
> this will break into a new line

- hr / tag
> similar to a br tag but will break between themes and split them

- href
> this specifies the path to a specific file

# JS & JQUERY (Jon Duckett pg. 53-84, 145-162)

- Statements
> a script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one by one.
> Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement

- A script will have to temporarily store the bits of info it need to do its job. It can store this data in variables

- Six steps to naming a variable
1. Must begin with a letter, $, or _ . Must not start with a number
2. You cannot use a dot or dash to name a variable
3. Cannot use key or reserved words
4. They are all case sensative, be careful with that
5. use a name that describes what the variable will be fore
6. use camel casing if multiple words in one variable

- an expression evaluates into a single value. Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions
1. Expressions that just assign a value to a variable
2. Expressions that use two or more values to return a single value
