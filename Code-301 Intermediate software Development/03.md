## React Docs - Lists and Keys

- What does .map() return?
> The .map() Method takes an array that is outside of a set function or arrow function and implements it within the function its called in

- If I want to loop through an array and display each value in JSX, how do I do that in React?
> const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const listItems = numbers.map((number) =>
  <li>{number}</li>
);
ReactDOM.render(
  <ul>{listItems}</ul>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);

- Each list item needs a unique ____. 

> Special String

## The Spread Operator

- What is the spread operator?
> The spread operator is a useful and quick syntax for adding items to arrays, combining arrays or objects, and spreading an array out into a function’s arguments.

- List 4 things that the spread operator can do.
> 1. Copy an array

> 2. Use Math functions

> 3. Add a state to react

> 4. Combine Objects


- Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two arrays.
>const fruits = ['🍏','🍊','🍌','🍉','🍍']
const moreFruits = [...fruits];
console.log(moreFruits) // Array(5) [ "🍏", "🍊", "🍌", "🍉", "🍍" ]
fruits[0] = '🍑'
console.log(...[...fruits,'...',...moreFruits]) //  🍑 🍊 🍌 🍉 🍍 ... 🍏 🍊 🍌 🍉 🍍

- Give an example of using the spread operator to add a new item to an array.
>const fewFruit = ['🍏','🍊','🍌']
const fewMoreFruit = ['🍉', '🍍', ...fewFruit]
console.log(fewMoreFruit) //  Array(5) [ "🍉", "🍍", "🍏", "🍊", "🍌" ]

- Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two objects into one.
>const objectOne = {hello: "🤪"}
const objectTwo = {world: "🐻"}
const objectThree = {...objectOne, ...objectTwo, laugh: "😂"}
console.log(objectThree) // Object { hello: "🤪", world: "🐻", laugh: "😂" }
const objectFour = {...objectOne, ...objectTwo, laugh: () => {console.log("😂".repeat(5))}}
objectFour.laugh() // 😂😂😂😂😂

# Video Notes
## How to Pass functions Between Components

In the video, what is the first step that the developer does to pass functions between components?

- increment = (person) => {
    let ppl = this.state.people.map((p) => {
      if(p.person === person){
        p.count++;
      }
      return p;
    })
    this.setState({people: ppl});
}

In your own words, what does the increment function do?

- It goes through an array and matches the name clicked and add to counter p by one every time it is clicked

How can you pass a method from a parent component into a child component?

-  .prop method

How does the child component invoke a method that was passed to it from a parent component?

- The same way you would pass it through a prop method
