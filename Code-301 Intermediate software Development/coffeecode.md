What do you wish you had known when you started out?
- The differnces between languages, or what "languages" even means. Wish what was known between different languages, starting off with java going into .Net. How they can be implemented, and the distinct differences and what they are used for. The main intircacy for languages and the differnces between them.   

How did you choose this industry, job, or company over others?
- Progamming as a whole is what brought him into this industry, mainly with the idea of building games and game design! From this became the general education that he sought in this field.

If I had an interview this week at your company, what advice would you give me?
- Depends on what stack is being saught after. Know the CRUD and how it relates to OOP and the web as a whole. A lot of questions asked being like what is CRUD? How does it relate to HTTP verbs? Be vocal just enough, not to much, not to little (problem solving and the thought process behind it). 

What are the best and worst parts of your job?

Best: 
1. The Ah-ha! moments. Programming is a problem solving field, and getting that solution is very satisfactory. Getting a feature that works perfectly, fixing a bug that has been there for a while.
2. Programming is just cool! Making rocks think is what programming is. 

Worst:
1. "Red Tape" : Sometimes being blocked on problems that are not caused by themselves but other people. Like progressing on a project, talking to a specific person that could be busy all day. Lots of delays from others
2. Burnout - self explanatory 

Afterwards, share with your classmates who you met with, a short summary of what you learned about that person, and what you will do to help them

What can I do to help them. Become a front end, full stack dev. Not a lot of people are front end devs. Most importantly, bring your own prespective to a problem. 

I met with a long time friend of mine Rian Schmit. Rian is a backend developer that programs primarily in C#. I asked him a few questions but I think what really shined over the rest were the Best and Worst parts of being a programmer. The best being every Ah-ha moment you come across, its like solving a puzzle or a bug that has been apparent for months. Another cool thing that he brought up was the fact that we make rocks think. It sounds rather silly but that is exactly what a computer is, a bunch of metals and alloys from the earth sending signals to each other. Despite something cool to think about like how we make rocks think is that is also downsides in the industry. A major one that was brought to my attention was "Red Tape". Red tape in a sense is being blocked with reasons outside your control, like needing to talk to a higher up for merging or discussion with application reasons. This happens more so often then you think and can prevent progress for either a short or a long period of time. Another major one being burnout, that one is rather self explanatory as staring at a screen all day can be rather tiring. As for what I can do to help my friend Rian, I can become a fullstack or a front end developer as the company he works at is in rather short demand and are quite needed.
