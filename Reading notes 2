There are TONS of text editors and IDE's available to the public via the internet, be it downloaded on your rig or accessed online entirely.
There are editors that are made specifically for man, windows, linux, as well as a few that are just all around available for any type of platform.
The ones that really shine are ones that aid you when coding, for example if it has a code completor or one that can use syntax highlighting

to name a few that can use that there is Notepad++, BB Edit, and the best one being VSC ( not becuase we use it for class or anything ).
what can really make a difference is an application that can combine features that are exlusive to other programs such as an IDE. 
Albeit an IDE is for more experienced coders it seems to be the most practical for overall use for them all. 
Overall it comes down to personal preference to the individual and what they are most comftorable and efficient in.
