## In Tests We Trust - TDD with Python
- Unit tests are pieces of code that are made to exercise input, output, and to verify the behavior of implemented code
- With TDD tests, tests are thought about first
- Structure AAA
  - Arrange: organizing data
  - Act: Execute tested code
  - Assert: Checking to see if output is expected
- There are three steps for this cycle 
  - Writing a unite test and seeing if it fails
  - Write the code and make sure it pass a test
  - Refactor until correct

## If name equals main
- Files in python can be standalone or reusable modules
- If the interpreter is running a module as a main program it sets a value to "main"
- you can run a file by doing: python (filename).py in terminal

## What on earth is recursion?
- Each variable must be kept seperate since they have the same assigned name otherwise the values will conflict with one another
- The main program runs its code until it gains all info it needs and then works inside out to gain an output
