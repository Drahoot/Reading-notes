## List Comprehensions
- Use nested loops instead of for loops
- In order for a list comprehension to work it needs:
  - A carried out expression
  - Object that the expression will work within
  - Iterable list of objs to build a new list
- List comprehension is more flexible than loops
- Filters can be added and can act as an conditional statement
- It is entirely possible to work on parts of a list using only filters
- You can parse a file using List comprehension
- lower() and upper() can be used within a list comprehension
