# [Python Regular Expression tutorial](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/python-regular-expression-tutorial)
- Regular expressions (often shortened as regex) are a sequence of characters used to chech whether a pattern exists in a given string
- They are used at the server side to verify the format of emails and passwords during registration
  - used to parse data to find replace or delete certain strings
- Regular expressions are supported by the re module
  - use "import re"
- use you can use the match() method to verify a string of characters
  - it will return True or false dependant on input
- a period will match any single character except a newline character
  - IE re.search(r'Co.k.e', 'Cookie').group()
- Using a carrot (^) matches the start of a string
  - ie re.search(r'^Eat', "Eat Cake!").group()
- Using $ matches the end of string
  - ie re.search(r'cake$', "Cake! Let's eat cake").group()
- You can even search for every letter and number there is using [a-zA-Z0-9]
- you can search for repetition using the + symbol
  - IE re.search(r'Co+kie', 'Cooookie').group() 
  - this will return 'Cooookie'
- Using the ? will determine if there is any variation in a string
  - IE re.search(r'Colou?r', 'Color').group()
  - (since we dont use the u here in the US) this will return 'Color'

# [Shutil](https://pymotw.com/3/shutil/)
- Shutil is a module that includes high level file operations such as copying and archiving
- copyfile() function will copy all contents of source file and raises IOError if it doesnt have any permissions
- there are multiple variations of the copyfile function
  - copyfile()
  - copyfileobj()
  - copy()
  - copy2()
- To copy permissions from a file you can use the copymode() method
- for metadata, copystat()
- you can even copy trees using copytree()
- There is a filter method to find a specific file, to filter use the which() method
