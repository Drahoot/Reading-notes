### What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?
- Myself and way of thinking and problem solving is something that nobody else can mimic in any work environment


### What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?
1. Understand: Know exactly what is being asked of you
2. Plan: Analyze the situation and create a plan before diving head first into solutions
3. Divide: Create smaller goals to acheive instead of one large goal, this will help manage the stress of acheiving whatever goal you desire and make them easier
