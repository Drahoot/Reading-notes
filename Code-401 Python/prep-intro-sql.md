# SQL Practice

## Thoughts

I think this was an excellent way for me to kick off my SQL learning experience. The interactive experience made it easy for me to imagine the possibilities of how I will be able to use SQL in my future projects/assignments. I felt like this lesson was very intuitive and helpful. I also printed out and saved it here, a cheat sheet for basic SQL syntax.
