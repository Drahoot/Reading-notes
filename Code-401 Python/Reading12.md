## Pandas in 10
- Create a series by passing in a list of values and let pandas create an index
- Create a DataFrame and pass in a NumPy array with labeled columns
- Create a DF by passing a dictionary of objects that can be converted into a series-like structure
- Columns can have a few different dtyps
- To get the top and bottom rows you can use these methods:
  - For the top: df.head()
  - For the bottom: df.tail()
- Display index and columns: 
  - df.index
  - df.columns
- df.to_numpy() will give a Numpy representaion of the underlying data
- df.describe() shows a quick statistics summary of the data set
- df.sort_index(axis, ascending= ) sorting by an axis
- slice rows: []
